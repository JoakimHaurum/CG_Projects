# CG_Projects
Repository of the different Computer Graphics projects that I'm working on in my spare time. Mostly focused on shader programming.

Some of the implemented CG code is based on the exercises from the Computer Graphics Programming course at Aalborg University, taught by Associate Professor Martin Kraus. These shaders are also doccumented at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity
